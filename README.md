- **Specialty**: Using algorithms to design ETL packages/modules

## 💡 My Design Philosophy (what you can expect)
- **Modular & Maintainable Architecture**: I design ETL pipelines as loosely coupled, reusable components to simplify debugging, enable parallel development, and support future scalability.

- **Cloud-Native & Cost-Efficient**: I leverage managed cloud services (e.g., AWS Glue, BigQuery, GCS, S3) and infrastructure-as-code to optimize for reliability, performance, and cost, while maintaining security best practices.
  
- **Data Quality & Observability First**: I embed validation, logging, and monitoring at each pipeline stage to ensure data integrity, enable fast issue detection, and support confident decision-making downstream.

## 🔭 What I’m Learning
- **RegEx**
- **Apache Pulsar** 
- **Go (for writing Kafka producers and multithreading)**
