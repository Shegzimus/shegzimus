## 🌟 About Me
- ⚙️ **Data Engineer** skilled in building modular cloud-based ETL pipelines.
- 🔢 **Academic background in Mathematics (BSc) & Data Science (MSc)**
- 💼 **Brief career in Management & Public Health Consulting**
- 💻 Passionate about **data architecture development**, and **containerized workflows**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack: [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,terraform,postgres,bash,docker,redis,regex,github,git,gcp,aws,kafka,latex,vscode,windows )](https://skillicons.dev)

- **Specialty**: Writing readable & refactorable ETL scripts/modules and configuring Virtual machines and Docker images/containers with Terraform

## 💡 My Design Philosophy (what you can expect)
- **Scalable and Delegable Pipelines**: I believe in designing easy pipelines to operate and maintain
  so that teams can focus on creating new solutions and solving other challenges. This approach contrasts with the 
  belief that only the author can maintain their code. Good pipelines require little to no author intervention after deployment.
  
- **Functionality before refinement**: I work to get things off the ground and start with a pipeline that works—delivering value quickly—before refining it into a more polished, future-proof version. This saves time and lets me adapt designs based on real-world feedback.
  
- **Security and Modularity as Cornerstones**: Secure and modular designs are fundamental to my work. I focus (too much sometimes) on implementing
  best practices like secret management, non-hardcoded paths, and modular structures to ensure pipelines are robust, compliant, and easy to maintain.

## 🔭 What I’m Learning
- **RegEx**
- **JVM languages (Java & Scala)**
- **Go (for writing Kafka producers and multithreading)**
