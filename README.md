## 🌟 About Me
- ⚙️ **Data Engineer** skilled in building robust and scalable ETL pipelines for cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
- 🔢 **Academic background in Mathematics & Data Science** with proven abilities in problem-solving and analogous thinking.
- 💼 **Brief career in Management & Public Health Consulting** where I delivered data-driven strategies across various industries.
- 💻 Passionate about **data pipeline development**, and **containerized workflows**.

## 🛠️ Key Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, PySpark, HCL.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Docker, Airflow, Terraform, AWS (S3, Glue, EC2), GCP (BigQuery, Storage, Cloud Run).
- **Behavioral Strengths**: Seeing the "bigger picture", abstracting ideas and **integrating client expectations into my solution design process**.
- **Tech Specialties**: Writing readable & refactorable ETL functions and configuring Docker images/containers.

## 💡 My Design Philosophy (what you can expect)
- **Scalable and Delegable Pipelines**: I believe in designing pipelines that are easy to operate and maintain
  so that teams can focus on creating new solutions and solving other challenges. This approach contrasts with the common
  belief that only the author can maintain their code. Good pipelines require little to no author intervention after deployment.
  
- **Functionality before refinement**: I believe in getting things off the ground and starting with a pipeline that works—delivering value quickly—before refining it into a more polished, future-proof version. This saves time and lets me adapt designs based on real-world feedback.
  
- **Security and Modularity as Cornerstones**: Secure and modular designs are fundamental to my work. I focus (too much sometimes) on implementing
  best practices like secret management, non-hardcoded paths, and modular structures to ensure pipelines are robust, compliant, and easy to maintain.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Building a weekly ETL pipeline for [Near Earth Objects](https://github.com/Shegzimus/DE_NASA_NeoW_Pipeline) (asteroids) and [Coronal Mass Ejections](https://github.com/Shegzimus/DE_NASA_CME_Pipeline) using NASA's API. 
- An AI model that deploys metaheuristic algorithms to plan and optimize grocery lists based on customer location and product proxy/availability; maximizing/minimizing variables based on fitness goals, nutrition density & budget.
- Building a pipeline with dynamic workload management capabilities using Airflow sensors and Spark to adjust resource allocation based on data volume.
- Designing a player database for a League of Legends discord group to track in-house scrims, tournaments and player stats.

## 📈 Recent Projects
